## Application Flow

When you start Landscape Decision Theatre, you'll see the **Landing Page** with two main options:

1. **About** -- learn about the project, funders, and open source nature
2. **Projects** -- access your saved projects or create new ones

From the Projects page, you can:

- **Create** a new project with a title, description, and optional thumbnail image
- **Open** an existing project to view and edit the map analysis
- **Clone** a project to create a copy with the same settings
- **Delete** projects you no longer need

Each project saves its state, including:

- Selected scenarios for left and right map sides
- Selected attribute for choropleth colouring
- Map viewport (center, zoom, bearing, pitch)
