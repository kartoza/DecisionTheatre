# Using the Map

The map interface is the primary way to explore catchment data in Decision Theatre.

## Map Controls

- **Pan** -- click and drag to move the map
- **Zoom** -- scroll wheel, pinch gesture, or double-click to zoom in; shift+double-click to zoom out
- **Rotate** -- right-click and drag, or use the compass control
- **Reset bearing** -- click the compass icon to reset north

## Map Layers

The map displays several vector layers at different zoom levels:

- **African countries** -- country boundaries and labels (visible from zoom 2)
- **Ecoregions** -- ecological region boundaries (visible from zoom 2)
- **Rivers** -- major river networks (visible from zoom 6)
- **Lakes** -- lake boundaries (visible from zoom 6)
- **Populated places** -- cities and towns (visible from zoom 6)
- **Catchments** -- level-12 catchment boundaries (visible from zoom 8)

## Swipe View

The map supports a side-by-side comparison mode using a vertical swipe divider. The left side shows one scenario and the right side shows another. Drag the divider to reveal more of either side.

## Header Status Indicators

The header bar shows the status of application components:

- **Tiles** -- green when map tile data is loaded
- **LLM** -- green when an AI language model is available
- **NN** -- green when a neural network model is loaded
